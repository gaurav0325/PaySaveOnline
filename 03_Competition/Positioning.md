# Market Positioning – PaySaveOnline

**Tagline:** “PaySmart — avoid hidden checkout fees.”

**Position:** the only privacy‑first browser extension in the UK/EU that actively protects users from FX mark‑ups and DCC traps during checkout.

**Differentiators:**
- Works silently on any checkout page.
- No data collection or account required.
- Designed for international shoppers and frequent travellers.
- Complements wallets like Revolut, rather than competing with them.
