# Competitive Landscape – PaySaveOnline

| Competitor | Focus | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Honey** | Coupons & discounts | Huge user base, merchant integrations | Ignores FX/DCC; U.S.-centric |
| **Capital One Shopping** | Retail discounts | Financial brand trust | No payment intelligence |
| **CardPointers** | Rewards optimisation | Helps maximise credit card rewards | Focused on U.S. issuers only |
| **Kudos** | Smart wallet and card advisor | Integrates card perks | Collects user data; app-only |
| **RateX** | Currency conversion at checkout | Offers FX awareness | No real-time DCC or surcharge detection |
| **Curve/Revolut/Wise** | Multi-card fintech wallets | Transparent FX rates | Not browser-integrated; post-checkout |

**Gap Identified:** none of the current extensions or fintechs offer a *real-time, browser-side* advisory focused on FX/DCC/surcharge avoidance for UK/EU shoppers.
